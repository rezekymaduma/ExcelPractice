# ExcelPractice
Excel Portfolio Project – LearnIt Series
This project was created as part of my journey to master Microsoft Excel by following comprehensive tutorials from LearnIt on YouTube. The tutorials I studied include:
•	Excel Beginner to Advanced Series
•	Visualize Your Data (Charts & Dashboards)
What I Learned
Throughout this project, I focused on developing hands-on skills in:
•	Excel formulas and functions (SUMIFS, IF, VLOOKUP, etc.)
•	Data visualization using charts (bar, line, pie, combo)
•	Data analysis techniques
•	Logical and lookup functions
•	Pivot tables and dynamic dashboards
Feel free to explore the project, clone it, and suggest improvements. I’m always open to feedback and collaboration!
